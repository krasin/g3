g3: 3d geometry in Go
==

[![Build Status](https://goci.herokuapp.com/project/image/github.com/krasin/g3 "Continous integration")](http://goci.me/project/github.com/krasin/g3)

This package defines primitives like Point, Vector, Triangle (float64-based),
as well as integer Node. It also has a basic support of a uniform Grid.

The immediate purpose of this library is to be a base for [github.com/krasin/voxel](http://github.com/krasin/voxel).
Theotically, it also might be useful for other uses.
